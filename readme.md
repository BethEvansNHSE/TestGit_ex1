# Basic Calculator 🤓🧮

Welcome to the most advanced, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art calculator you'll ever need. Forget quantum computing – this is where the real magic happens. ✨💻

## What's Inside? 🔍

This code has everything you need to tackle your day-to-day math struggles, except taxes – thankfully, HMRC has you covered for that... most of the time! 🎩💼

- **Addition** ➕: For when you find a bit of spare change under the sofa 🛋️💷.
- **Subtraction** ➖: For when you buy another round of tea ☕ (or something stronger 🥂) and need to adjust the budget.
- **Division** ➗: Share your fish and chips 🍟🐟 fairly! This ensures everyone gets an equal share.
- **Text Printing** 🖨️: Print whatever you like! Just don’t try to print the Queen’s speech. 👑

## How to Use:

1. Want to **add**? Use `add_numbers(num1, num2)` – ideal for tallying up how many trips to Greggs 🥧 you can afford this week.

2. Need to **subtract**? Use `subtract_numbers(num1, num2)` – subtract those sneaky expenses from your bank balance 🏦.

3. Feel like **printing** something? Type `print_text(blah)` – it prints what you want. It's like shouting into the void, but with a more polite British tone 🎤.

4. **Division**: For when you’ve got to share the last Yorkshire pudding 🥮. Use `divide_numbers(num1, num2)` to ensure fairness in all things culinary.

## Warning:

Using this calculator may lead to excessive mathematical confidence, and an increased desire to divide cups of tea ☕ and count biscuits 🍪. Use responsibly!
